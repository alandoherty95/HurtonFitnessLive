        "question": "Why I got into fitness",
        "answer": "I got into fitness at age 16. I was very unfit and had poor eating habits. My father had recently become more active at that time and asked me to join him in going to a bootcamp. I found it very difficult and so, it drove me to always push harder and better myself.",

        "question": "My favourites ways to exercise",
        "answer": "My favourite way to exercise would be a push/pull training plan. Push exercises involve working on muscles in the chest, shoulders and triceps. Pull would focus on legs and core. That being said, I really enjoy circuit training because it is challenging and makes me want to better my last attempt.",

Although not all my clients are young kids, the courage to try to learn an essential skill at any age is incredible and I find it very rewarding to be able to help them on this journey.",
